## Motivation

At WWDC 2019, Apple announced SwiftUI a new library for building UI in a simple and fast way.  
Xcode‚Äôs SwiftUI preview lets us show our application design in multiple screen sizes at the same time using the `.previewDevice()` modifier. Currently, this needs to be provided with the exact name of the device you want to test:  e.g. ‚ÄúiPhone XS Max‚Äù.

```swift
.previewDevice(PreviewDevice(rawValue: "iPhone XS Max"))
```
or even better

```swift
.previewDevice(.iPhone7)
```

This framework comes to rescue for everyone that are looking for an easy way to select their preview device or they just doesn't remember every iOS 13 device name (like me üòÄ)

## System Requirements

Supported platforms are `iOS (13.0)`, `tvOS (13.0)`, `watchOS (6.0)` and `macOS (10.15)` and of course `Xcode 11`.

## Installation

`SafePreviewDevice` can be installed via Swift Package Manager.

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's Swift package manager, add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/posix88/SafePreviewDevice.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0"))
```

and  run `swift package update`.

Otherwise you can simply go to File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency and paste the repo's url: `https://github.com/posix88/SafePreviewDevice`

### CocoaPods

Add the following entry to your Podfile:

```rb
pod 'SafePreviewDevice'
```

Then run `pod install`.

## Usage

Simply import this framework in your `SwiftUI` file and add one of this `View` modifier to your preview:

### Display a preview device
```swift
.previewDevice(.iPhone7)
```
This modifier will change the displayed device in the Xcode SwiftUI preview.

### Change the preview device name
```swift
.previewDeviceName(.iPhone7)
```
This modifier will change the displayed device name in the Xcode SwiftUI preview.

## What's new üöÄ

### Display a named preview device
```swift
.previewNamedDevice(.iPhone7)
```
This modifier is the union between the first APIs. 
It will change the displayed device in the Xcode SwiftUI preview setting also the device name.

### Display a preview device applying the color scheme
```swift
.previewDevice(.iPhone7, withColorScheme: .dark)
```
This modifier will change the displayed device in the Xcode SwiftUI preview. It also apply the selected color scheme.

### Display a named preview device applying the color scheme
```swift
.previewNamedDevice(.iPhone7, withColorScheme: .dark)
```
This modifier will change the displayed named device in the Xcode SwiftUI preview. It also apply the selected color scheme.

### Display a group of named preview device applying a list of color scheme
```swift
.previewDevices([.iPhone7, .iPhoneSE, .iPhoneX], withColorScheme: [.dark, .light])
```
This modifier provides an inline alternative to 
```swift
Group {
    MyView().previewDevice(.iPhone7, withColorScheme: .dark)
    MyView().previewDevice(.iPhone7, withColorScheme: .light)
    MyView().previewDevice(.iPhoneSE, withColorScheme: .dark)
    MyView().previewDevice(.iPhoneSE, withColorScheme: .light)
    MyView().previewDevice(.iPhoneX, withColorScheme: .dark)
    MyView().previewDevice(.iPhoneX, withColorScheme: .light)
}
```
