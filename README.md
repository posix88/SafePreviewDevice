## Motivation

At WWDC 2019, Apple announced SwiftUI a new library for building UI in a simple and fast way.  
Xcode‚Äôs SwiftUI preview lets us show our application design in multiple screen sizes at the same time using the `.previewDevice()` modifier. Currently, this needs to be provided with the exact name of the device you want to test:  e.g. ‚ÄúiPhone XS Max‚Äù.

```swift
.previewDevice(PreviewDevice(rawValue: "iPhone XS Max"))
```

This framework comes to rescue for everyone that want an easy way to select their preview device, and also for those who doesn't remember every iOS 13 supported device üòÄ (like me)

## System Requirements

Supported platforms are `iOS (13.0)`, `tvOS (13.0)`, `watchOS (6.0)` and `macOS (10.15)`

## Installation

`SafePreviewDevice` can be installed via Swift Package Manager.

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's Swift package manager, add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/posix88/SafePreviewDevice.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0"))
```

and  run `swift package update`.

Otherwise you can simply go to File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency and paste the repo's url: `https://github.com/posix88/SafePreviewDevice`
